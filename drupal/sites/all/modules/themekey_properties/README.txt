About
=====

"ThemeKey Properties" adds additional properties to ThemeKey module which
can be found at http://drupal.org/project/themekey

"ThemeKey", itself, provides an infrastructure to switch Drupal themes according
to rules which might use such properties.

Additional Properties provided by "ThemeKey Properties":
 - drupal:base_path
 - drupal:is_front_page
 - system:query_param
 - system:query_string
 - system:cookie
 - system:server_ip
 - system:server_port
 - system:server_name
 - system:https
 - system:remote_ip
 - system:referer
 - system:user_agent
 - system:user_browser
 - system:user_browser_simplified
 - system:user_os
 - system:user_os_simplified
 - system:date
 - system:time
 - system:date_time
 - system:session
 - system:day_of_week
 - system:dummy
 - user:role
 
ThemeKey Properties contains an additional module called
"ThemeKey Properties Debug". This sub module allows you to turn on
a debug feature that shows the current values of all properties on
every page including those properties provided by different modules.

The debug values are clickable. If you do so, you can easily start
creating a Theme Switching rule from this property and value.
