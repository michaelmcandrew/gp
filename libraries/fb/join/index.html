</p>
<p>
Become a Green Party member today and you'll be joining a community of people dedicated to creating social and environmental change.
</p>
<p>
We don't get donations from big corporations and unions like other parties -&nbsp;<strong>we rely on our members and supporters for funding</strong>&nbsp;- making us a truly independent voice in politics.
</p>
<h2 style="line-height: normal">Join by monthly or annual Direct Debit</h2>
<p>
You can join the Green Party via monthly Direct Debit which is our preferred method, as it helps save on administration costs. Through this kind of committed support we can plan our campaigns –&nbsp;<strong>month by month</strong>&nbsp;– secure in the knowledge that they are funded.
</p>
<p>
Please consider giving an additional donation on top of your membership fee. £5, £10 or even £20 a month could help provide the vital support that makes our campaigns and direct action for social and environmental justice possible.&nbsp;
